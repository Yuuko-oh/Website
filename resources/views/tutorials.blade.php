            Advertising your server is a great way to boost numbers and meet new and exciting people.
            Yuuko's advertise feature allows you to do this with other people who also have Yuuko on their server.
            Best of all it's quick and easy to both start and stop advertising on the website as seen below, so why not give it a try!
